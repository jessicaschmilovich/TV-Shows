# TV-Shows
TV Shows is a program that organizes TV show data by network, cast, and average episode duration. It allows users to search for shows by cast member, view shows sorted by duration, and add new shows to the collection while avoiding duplicates. The program reads and updates show data from a file. This was a school project.
